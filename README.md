Ubersystem Deploy Repository
============================

This module is your starting point for setting up ubersystem and working on it.  

It will check out a bunch of git repos and is the basis for both Vagrant setups and also production deployments.

More documentation is coming soon.


Getting started with Vagrant
===============

Short version that is pretty likely to work right now.

Clone this repository.

AS AN ADMINISTRATOR
```
cd ubersystem-deploy
vagrant up
```

In about 15 minutes you should have a fully functional ubersystem deployment accessible at http://localhost/
