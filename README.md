============================

This module is your starting point for setting up ubersystem and working on it.  

It will check out a bunch of git repos and is the basis for both Vagrant setups and also production deployments.

Docs are WIP, more a coming soon. If you need any help here, email code at magfest dot org.

Installation
=============

Use [Vagrant Install Instructions](INSTALL-vagrant.md) to setup a dev copy of ubersystem (new users, start here)

Use [Real Install Instructions](INSTALL-realserver.md) to setup a production server
