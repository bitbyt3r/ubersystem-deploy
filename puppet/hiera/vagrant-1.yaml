                # /home/vagrant/uber/ is being hosted on the HOST os and shared.
                # this is extremely convenient for development, but, disk IO is far slower
                # in shared folders.
                # ALTERNATIVELY, use this path instead for faster deploys/IO,
                # but it will move the repo out of the HOST os's shared folder
                # which will result in not being able to edit these directly on the shared host.
                # it also means that you have to have the GUEST machine powered up in order to access the files,
