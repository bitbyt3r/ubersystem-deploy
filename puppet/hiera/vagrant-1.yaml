                # ALTERNATIVELY, use this path instead for faster deploys/IO,
                # but it will move the repo out of the HOST os's shared folder
                # which will result in not being able to edit these directly on the shared host.
                # it also means that you have to have the GUEST machine powered up in order to access the files,
                # and if you destroy the machine you will lose uncommited changes.
